    "# Smart Queue Monitoring System\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will build a people counter app to reduce congestion in queuing systems by guiding people to the least congested queue. You will have to use Intel's OpenVINO API and the person detection model from their open model zoo to build this project. It demonstrates how to create a smart video IoT solution using Intel® hardware and software tools. This solution detects people in a designated area, providing the number of people in the frame.\n",

    "## Overview of how it works\n",
    "Your code should read the equivalent of command line arguments and loads a network and image from the video input to the Inference Engine (IE) plugin. A job is submitted to an edge compute node with a hardware accelerator such as Intel® HD Graphics GPU, Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2 and Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA.\n",
    "After the inference is completed, the output videos are appropriately stored in the /results/[device] directory, which can then be viewed within the Jupyter Notebook instance.\n",
